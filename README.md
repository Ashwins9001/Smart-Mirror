# Smart-Mirror
Display for a smart mirror created using Qt in C++. Display able to show:
- Recently played songs through integration with the Spotify API by regenerating refresh tokens upon GET requests
- Weather data by fetching it from an open-source API
- Time by fetching it from OS
- Tweets for a particular individual with Twitter API integration

Additional functionality includes a smart power-saving mode enabled by polling motion detection readings from a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor that sends data over a serial connection from an Arduino to the Raspberry Pi that the software runs on. 

Software designed with design patterns in mind to improve development time including:
- Factory design pattern to generate various APIs for data fetching
- MVC pattern to decouple the user interface from the model for a parallelized workflow
- Observer design pattern to fetch data when changes are detected for a seamless user experience

UML highlighting the software functionality shown as follows:
